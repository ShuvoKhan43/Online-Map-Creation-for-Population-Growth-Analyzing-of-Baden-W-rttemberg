Project Title: Online Map Creation for Population Growth Analysis

Description:
This project, developed during my master's GIS Studio course, aims to analyze population growth using a dashboard interface. Leveraging open data from the Landesamt Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the project visualizes population distribution and trends through interactive maps and insightful graphs. Built with Flask, MapLibre, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides an engaging and user-friendly way to explore demographic changes over time.

Features:
Interactive maps for population visualization
Population growth projections
Dashboard with charts and graphs for trends analysis
This repository contains all necessary files and codes to replicate or further enhance the project.
